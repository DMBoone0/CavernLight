# CavernLight

A turn-based DRPG built from scratch in Python using Pygame. Primarily inspired by the Etrian Odyssey franchise, Eye of the Beholder, Potato Flowers in Full Bloom, and others. Built around low-graphics pseudo-3D rendering via raycasting, grid-based exploration, and party-based combat.

##  Features

- **Pseudo-3D Rendering**: Raycasting for first-person views of walls, floors, and ceilings.
- **Grid-Based Movement**: Movement and 90-degree turns on a 2D map grid.
- **Party System**: Manage a group of characters with stats, equipment, and turn-based combat.
- **UI Overlays**: Menus for character sheets, messages, and encounters.
- **Extras**: Simple audio effects, save/load functionality.

This is a basic prototype. I aim to add additional functionality in the future. I would like to tool this as a custom engine for use in future projects.
